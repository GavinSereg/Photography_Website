# Photography_Website

Final Project for Web Development at Kirkwood Community College.

The website idea came from my mom. She has a photography business and wanted me to create her a website, which will later be hosted for her purposes. The site doesn't have her info on it yet, becasue I used the idea for my school project. Although, I have plans to customize it to her liking, and then host it via S3 bucket or Github Pages.
